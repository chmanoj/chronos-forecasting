# Chronos MoE Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a flexible Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture for Chronos with two distinct modes, addressing all device allocation issues and providing comprehensive testing.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dual Architecture Support
- **`shared_then_expert`**: Shared encoder + expert prediction heads (parameter efficient)
- **`expert_only`**: Shared embedding + expert encoders + expert heads (maximum specialization)

### 2. Configuration
```python
@dataclass
class ChronosConfig:
    # MoE parameters
    use_moe: bool = False
    num_experts: int = 8
    num_active_experts: int = 2
    expert_capacity: Optional[int] = None
    load_balancing_weight: float = 0.01
    router_hidden_dim: int = 256
    
    # Architecture choice
    moe_architecture: Literal["shared_then_expert", "expert_only"] = "shared_then_expert"
    shared_layers: Optional[int] = None  # For shared_then_expert mode
```

### 3. Key Components

#### Context Router
- Sample-level routing (not token-level)
- Top-k expert selection
- Load balancing support

#### Expert Architectures
- **MoEExpertHead**: Simple prediction heads for shared_then_expert mode
- **MoEExpertEncoder**: Full transformer encoders for expert_only mode

#### Device Handling
- Proper device management for MPS/CUDA/CPU
- Automatic fallback to CPU for training when MPS allocation issues occur
- Consistent tensor device placement throughout forward pass

### 4. Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | shared_then_expert | expert_only |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Parameter Efficiency** | High (1.4x regular model) | Lower (2-3x regular model) |
| **Specialization** | Prediction patterns only | Input + prediction patterns |
| **Interpretability** | Good | Excellent |
| **Memory Usage** | Lower | Higher |
| **Use Case** | Similar inputs, different predictions | Different input domains |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
# Shared-then-expert (recommended for most cases)
config = ChronosConfig(
    use_moe=True,
    num_experts=8,
    num_active_experts=2,
    moe_architecture="shared_then_expert"
)

# Expert-only (for maximum specialization)
config = ChronosConfig(
    use_moe=True,
    num_experts=8,
    num_active_experts=2,
    moe_architecture="expert_only"
)
```

### Pipeline Creation
```python
base_model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("google/t5-efficient-tiny")
moe_model = ChronosMoEModel(config=config, model=base_model)
pipeline = ChronosMoEPipeline(tokenizer=config.create_tokenizer(), model=moe_model)
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Implementation
- `src/chronos/chronos.py`: Main MoE implementation
- `test_chronos_moe.py`: Comprehensive test suite

### Key Classes Added
- `MoEExpertEncoder`: Full expert encoders for expert_only mode
- Enhanced `ChronosMoEModel`: Dual architecture support

## Recommendations

### When to Use shared_then_expert
- Parameter efficiency is important
- Input patterns are similar
- Different prediction requirements (horizons, uncertainty levels)
- Limited computational resources

### When to Use expert_only
- Maximum expert specialization needed
- Fundamentally different input domains
- Sufficient computational resources
- Interpretability is crucial

### Configuration Tips
- Start with `shared_then_expert` for most use cases
- Use 4-8 experts initially, scale based on data diversity
- Set `num_active_experts=2` for good balance
- Use `load_balancing_weight=0.01` to encourage expert utilization
